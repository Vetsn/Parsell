# Parsell
Parser tools for A-cell, a commercial software by dedicated for biological simulations.
While A-cell is capable of constructing simulation programs, handling large 3D(4D) models with the default features can be a repetetive and time-consuming task.

This repository is dedicated to providing tools for facilitating 4D model-manipulation with A-cell.
